# Source Control

Add all of your code into the [capcodigital](https://github.com/capcodigital) github organisation. Ensure that you have reviewed the [Git flow Branching](https://ilabs-capco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BPG/pages/411369488/Git+flow+Branching) guidelines for Capco. 

## Task

-   Create a new public repository within the [capcodigital](https://github.com/capcodigital) github organisation to store all of your java code. This can be stored in the master branch. 
-   Create a .gitignore file. This should include the names of any paths which should be excluded from source control (git, gradle, build files). Remember to consider hidden files. 
-   You can follow this tutorial to add the initial commit to git <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/>
-   Use **git status** to ensure that only the desired files are going to be committed and pushed.
-   Note that you may have to run the following command:

>     git push -uf origin master

to force the initial commit
