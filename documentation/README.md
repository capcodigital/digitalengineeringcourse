# Digital Engineer Induction Course

## Introduction

The purpose of this space is to give an introductory course to Capco Digital Engineers.

It is designed so that new and established engineers can be given some pre-defined tasks which will allow new joiners to get familiar with the technology, standards and practices and training that are used and available to us at Capco.

The course is split into development and training tasks.

There are two routes that you can take for this, both of which are relevant to the tech stacks that will be covered during your time at Capco.

* [NodeJs (Express)](node/README.md)
* [Java (SpringBoot)](java/README.md)
