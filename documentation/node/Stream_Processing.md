# Stream Processing

 The purpose of this task is to setup a Kafka/Zookeeper docker installation and to write events from our Node.js application to a new topic.

## Task

You can follow a tutorial [here](http://www.baeldung.com/spring-kafka).

* Create and start zookeeper, kafka, a schema registry, kafka-rest, kafka topics ui and more by downloading the following file: `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` from the folder containing the .yml file.

* Then create a new topic called "test". You may need to change the network depending on which network you docker containers are deployed to:

```shell
docker run --rm --network deploy_default ches/kafka kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --zookeeper zoo1:2181

Created topic "test"
```

* Check that the topic exists by browsing to the Kapka Topics UI. It may need a minute to load, so may show a connection error to begin with.

* Add "kafka1" mapping to localhost to your /etc/hosts file e.g. `127.0.0.1    kafka1`

* Modify your Node.js code to write to this new topic "test" by following the example [here](http://www.baeldung.com/spring-kafka). You only require the Producer Config and Sending messages section (4.1 and 4.2).

* Write to the topic e.g. on POSTing a new USER
* Check that the message is received on the topic

* Run a test command line consumer by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --network digital-engineering-course_default ches/kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic test --from-beginning --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing a bug where your application is creating a topic but not publishing/writing any message, check below for a possible solution:

* For an application running in your local machine, in your Kafka producer, make sure the address is localhost + port in this case the port is 9092 - `var bootstrapAddress = "localhost:9092";`

* In your application running in your container your address need to be kafka1, the same name mapped to localhost in our host file - `var bootstrapAddress = "kafka1:9092";`

* Make sure that all your containers (application, database, kafka, etc...) are running under the same network

```shell
# list exiting networks
docker network ls

# Inspect networks configuration and all containers running on it, look for the one where your kafka is running
docker network inspect network-name

# add a container to a specific network
docker network connect container id/name

# create a new network
docker network create network-name
```
