# Digital Engineer Induction Course

## Introduction

The purpose of this space is to give an introductory course to Capco Digital Engineers. It is designed so that new and established engineers can be given some pre-defined tasks which will allow new joiners to get familiar with the technology, standards and practices and training that are used and available to us at Capco. The course will be split into development and training tasks.

If you complete all of the tasks, you will have covered:

* Creating a Node.js Express REST application.
* Documentation of your REST API.
* Persisting data in a Mongo Database and will correctly handle exceptions.
* Code will be stored in the git source control system, automatically build and uploaded as a Docker container.
* Log files will be written to an Elastic Search (ELK) instance.
* The application will write messages to a Kafka event stream "Topic".
* All of this will be hosted on a Kubernetes cluster on the Google Cloud Platform and will be highly scalable.

## Notes

Strongly advise reading all steps before starting the induction. Future steps may change the way you complete certain tasks along the way.

## Development Tasks

The development tasks are designed to be small units of work that a new joiner can research and complete individually or collaborate with other colleagues.
