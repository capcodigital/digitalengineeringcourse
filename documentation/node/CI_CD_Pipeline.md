# CI/CD Pipeline

## Task

The task is to setup the CircleCI continuous integration tool to automatically build the Node.js application.

* Browse to circleci.com and login with your github account.
* Give access to your account and setup the project which you added to git in the previous task.
* Follow the steps to create the project:

* Setup the ".circleci/config.yml" file and add the "circleci/mongo:3.6" as a dependency.
* Add and push the file to git and ensure that your build runs successfully.

* Try removing the mongo dependency from your config.yml file. Push the change and ensure that your integration tests fail:

* Add the test results of the build to circleci <https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/test-metadata/#gradle-junit-results>
* If the test results are written to your "build/test-results/" folder, you could add the following .yml to your `config.yml` file to achieve that:

```yaml
    - run:
        name: save test results
        command: |
            mkdir -p ~/junit/
            find . -type f -regex ".*/build/test-results/.*xml" -exec cp {} ~/junit/ \;
        when: always
            - store_test_results:
                path: ~/junit
            - store_artifacts:
                path: ~/junit 
```
