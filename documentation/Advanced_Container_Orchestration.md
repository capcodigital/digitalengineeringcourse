# Advanced Container Orchestration

The purpose of this task is to enhance our Kubernetes infrastructure and add the ELK stack docker to our setup. The existing java application docker will need to be modified to send the logs to logstash. We also need to expose the Kibana port, so that the log files are exposed.
