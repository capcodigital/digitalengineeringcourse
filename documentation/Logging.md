# Logging

This task is to review the Capco [logging standards](https://ilabs-capco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BPG/pages/411566109/Microservice+Logging) and to setup [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/) logging to implement these standards. [Java Logging](https://ilabs-capco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BPG/pages/411369509/Java+Logging)

## Task

-   Implement log4j into your java code and ensure that a log file is created in a specified folder
-   Ensure that the log includes details about your application, has UTC time format and that the individual java method is output in the log.
-   Ensure that you can alter the log level and that INFO, WARN and ERROR messages are correctly output or omitted from the log file. Add INFO, WARN and ERROR logging to your existing code if required.
