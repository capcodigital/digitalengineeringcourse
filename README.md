## Purpose

This repo holds the introductory Digital Engineering training course.  The purpose of the course is to provide a good introduction to technologies that are commonly used by Capco Digital on client engagements.

The course is not meant as an extensive training in the specific technologies, a list or resources have been curated that will be useful for that purpose, as have Udemy channels been setup aligned to the Engineering development paths.
